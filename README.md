scheduled/actual departure and arrival times

## Data cleaning and manipulation
data cleaning process susch as removal of NA values, removal NULL values, removal of duplicates values, coverting of each features to the appropriate data type was done in power query
Modelling of the data was done in power pivot
creating of new features required for further analysis was done in power pivot
creating of new measures required for further analysis was done using DAX(data analysis expression)

## Analysis
all the analysis were done using pivot table
