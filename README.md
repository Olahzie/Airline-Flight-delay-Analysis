This analysis seek to answer the follwing questions:
1. How does the overall flight volume vary by month? By day of week?
2. What percentage of flights experienced a departure delay in 2015? Among 
those flights, what was the average delay time, in minutes?
3. How does the % of delayed flights vary throughout the year? What about for 
flights leaving from Boston (BOS) specifically?
4. How many flights were cancelled in 2015? What % of cancellations were due to 
weather? What % were due to the Airline/Carrier?

## Data collection
Records for 5,000,000+ commercial airline flights in 2015, compiled for the U.S. DOT 
Air Travel Consumer Report. Each record represents a single flight, including the airline 
name, flight number, origin/destination airport and flight distance, as well as 
scheduled/actual departure and arrival times

## Data cleaning and manipulation
data cleaning process susch as removal of NA values, removal NULL values, removal of duplicates values, coverting of each features to the appropriate data type was done in power query
Modelling of the data was done in power pivot
creating of new features required for further analysis was done in power pivot
creating of new measures required for further analysis was done using DAX(data analysis expression)

## Analysis
All the analysis and visualisation were done using pivot table and microsoft excel chart option

## Conclusion
The following can be concluded based on the observation made from the above analysis

There is a consistent decline in the overall volume of flight over the month
There is a variation in the overall volume of flight over the which shows airlines experience high demand at the beginning of a week and during the end of a week, while they experience low demand during the weekend
There is a common trends between the overall flight volume and the delayed flight volume over time which shows that flight volume is major determinant of delayed flight
Majority of flight cancelled by airline is due to the weather condition
Hawaiian airline is the most reliable airline in terms of on-time departure with the average time of 1.5, while frontier airline is the least reliable with average time of 22.8
